"""Step 9.4b: cross-family Qwen3-4B throughput analyzer.

This analyzer safely combines two ``benchmark.py`` artifacts per dataset,
produced by ``run_step9_4b_throughput.sh``:

* the "original" DFlash family (``--draft-type dflash``), which yields the
  sequential baseline plus raw DFlash and original DDTree at B16/B32/B64,
  and
* the "DFlash2" family (``--draft-type dflash2``), which yields its own
  copy of the sequential baseline plus raw DFlash2, DFlash2 original-DDTree
  at B7/B16/B32/B64, Pairwise-K16 at B7/B16/B32/B64, and the fixed
  Unary-K16 diagnostic at B32/B64.

Both families share the same pinned target commit/revision, the same
target hardware, and the same dataset/prompt/decoding settings, so their
per-prompt outputs can be paired directly. The primary research question is
whether DFlash2 Pairwise-K16 is faster (tokens/s) than DFlash2
original-DDTree at the matched budget B16; every other comparison is
secondary and is explicitly labeled "controlled" (same drafter family) or
"cross_drafter" (different drafter checkpoints) so the two kinds of
evidence are never conflated.

A separate timing-runner effort wired ``end_to_end_timing_fields()`` (see
``dflash.py``) into every ``*_generate`` variant (``dflash.py``,
``ddtree.py``, ``dflash2.py``, ``dflash2_tree.py`` all now call it and
splat ``total_generation_time``/``tokens_per_second`` into their results),
but that integration may still evolve (new fields, renamed fields) and
older/partial artifacts predating it may still show up for smoke analysis.
All access to those fields goes through ``extract_timing_fields`` below:
the foundational fields that have always existed are required
unconditionally, and the end-to-end fields are required in strict mode but
only derived (and clearly flagged as derived) under ``--allow-partial``.
That fallback omits the first draft round, so it underestimates total time
and overestimates throughput; partial-mode values are diagnostic only.
Update that one function, not the call sites, if the schema changes again.

Every ``*_generate`` result also now carries repetition bookkeeping from
``benchmark.py``'s ``--timing-repetitions``/``attach_repetition_bookkeeping``
(a ``.repetitions`` list of every repeated measurement of that turn, plus
top-level ``.prompt_id``/``.prompt_hash``) and a top-level
``target_dtype``/``draft_dtype``/``target_attn_implementation``/
``draft_attn_implementation`` on the artifact. Aggregation therefore
happens in two explicit stages so repetitions and multi-turn conversations
(e.g. MT-Bench) are never treated as independent prompts: repeated
measurements of the *same* turn are averaged (``aggregate_repetitions``),
then turns belonging to the *same* conversation are combined by summing
tokens/time/target-calls and recomputing throughput from those sums
(``aggregate_turns_to_conversation``) -- never by arithmetic-averaging
each turn's own tokens/s.

Correctness is always recomputed by the analyzer directly from
``output_ids`` tensors (``exact_output_match``); the serialized
``.matches_baseline`` flag benchmark.py also writes is never read. A
mismatch between a speculative method and its own family's baseline is
recorded (never dropped) in ``correctness.csv``'s exact-match rate, but
never raises. Cross-family artifact pairing additionally requires
``validate_cross_family`` to confirm that *baseline* output is identical
between the two families for every paired response under controlled
trajectories (and for turn 0 only under native-trajectory MT-Bench, since
later native turns condition on each process's own prior-turn generation);
this is the one correctness check that fails strict pairing, because both
families run the identical target/prompt/settings and a divergent
baseline means the pairing itself is unsound.
